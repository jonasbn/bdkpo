Project Change Log:

http://logiclab.jira.com/browse/BDKPO#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Achangelog-panel

Release 0.05 - Released Wed Sep  8 2010, update not required

- Added wrapper on validate method, so we now also export a validatePO, which
  is less intrusive [BDKPO-2]

- Added prerequisites test [BDKPO-1]

- Beautified code with Perl::Tidy and did basic Perl::Critic violation cleanup


Release 0.04 - Released Tue Mar 13 2007

- Added some POD, nothing significant

- Fixed problem in t/critic.t, I had implemented a mix of my own and the
  recommended Perl::Critic test, so it gave unforseen test failures


Release 0.03 - Released Mon Mar 12 2007

- Set severity of Perl::Critic test to 5, gentle

- Updated t/kwalitee.t to more contemporary version

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and added perlcriticrc to t/

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Tue Feb 21 2006

- Added version information to POD

- Added related module to SEE ALSO section in POD

- Added private message to EXPORT_OK and updated POD

- Added use of MODULUS_OPERAND in one place, apparently this had been overlooked

- Removed some verbose message from unit-tests

- Restructured tests some positive tests are first in the file


Release 0.01 - Released Mon Feb 20 2006

- Initial version
