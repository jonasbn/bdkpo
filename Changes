HEAD

- Updated t/kwalitee.t to more contemporary version

- Added Perl::Critic test, t/critic.t and added perlcriticrc to t/

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.
